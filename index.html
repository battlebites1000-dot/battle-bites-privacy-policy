  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="meta">Last updated: October 19, 2025</div>

  <p><strong>Battle Bites</strong> is a casual mobile game that shows ads using Google AdMob. We take your privacy seriously and explain below what data may be collected, how it’s used, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect information that directly identifies you (like your name or email) inside the app.</li>
    <li>The app uses third-party services (notably <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> / <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob</a>) that may collect device information and an advertising identifier to show and measure ads.</li>
    <li>Gameplay choices (e.g., which animal you pick) may be stored in our backend in an anonymized way to compute aggregate statistics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on your device and settings, the app and its SDK partners may process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App activity:</strong> Basic gameplay interactions (e.g., which option you selected, counters for wins/losses) used to show aggregate stats and improve the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Device information &amp; identifiers:</strong> Such as device model, OS version, IP address (for general location like country/region), crash logs, and <strong>Advertising ID (AAID)</strong> on Android, collected by AdMob/Google Play services for ad delivery, frequency capping, and fraud prevention.</li>
